        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p class= 'index-bio'>I live in Ventura County, Califirnia. In my free time I enjoy golf, basketball, and attending concerts. So far this feels like i'm creating a dating profile. I should change my writing style. By the way, I also attended San Diego State University where i got a degree in Economics, a degree that i'm putting to good use by taking a computer coding class.</p>
